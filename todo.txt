1. Implement location storage
    + track player movements
    + keep track of accessible way points
2. Implement algorithm for getting path to a location through a list of known way points
    - generate a path to a mob consisting of way points to visit
        * firstly, assume direct line is available and generate way points
        * if player is stuck at some point on that line invalidate remaining points of the line and try to rebuild using known locations
3. Alter mob search machine:
    - make it independent, if it's called it handles all journey details
    - add detection when player is stuck, call algorithm for rebuilding path
