1. Implement location storage
    + track player movements
    + keep track of accessible way points
2. Implement algorithm for getting path to a location through a list of known way points
    + generate a path to a mob consisting of way points to visit
        * firstly, assume direct line is available and generate way points
        * if player is stuck at some point on that line invalidate remaining points of the line and try to rebuild using known locations
    - take smooth path algorithms from Trinity project
3. Alter mob search machine:
    + make it independent, if it's called it handles all journey details
    + add detection when player is stuck, call algorithm for rebuilding path
4. Add mechanism for tracking known buttons on the screen
    - it should return certain events which should have handlers attached
5. Add state machine for picking up the body
6. Add state machine for selling junk loot
    - research NPC database to locate closests
